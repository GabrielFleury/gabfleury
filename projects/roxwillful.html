	<h1>The Unfortunate Adventures of Rox Willful (2016)</h1>
	<p>This is an Unreal 4 game made with a team of 10. It started as our final project at NAD and is slowly being wrapped up in our spare time.<br />
	Rox Willful is a sci-fi point-and-click game exploring post-war themes with quirky humor. The player has to resolve conflicts through dialogue, trading and minigames.</p>
	<p>It got <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=681309671" target="_blank">Greenlit on Steam</a>.

		<ul>
		<li>Work with the writer to plan and tell a story through a non-linear series of events.</li>
		<li>Create clever and intuitive puzzles that fit within the writer's overarching story.</li>
		<li>Make sure the entire game was possible with our limited resources in modeling.</li>

	<h2>Narrative design</h2>
	<p>
	We have an award winning writer on our team, but while he loves video games, his only experience in professional writing is from movies and television. I had regular meetings with him so we could come up with a story that made sense to play, with dialogue choices and some non-linearity. Below is the format I ended up making to keep everything organized. It is a flowchart containing all the possibilities of dialogue and interaction:
	</p>
	
	<div class="side-left" style="width:40%; margin-left:15%;">
		<div class="showcase_container"><img src="img/SpaceDiner_Flowchart.jpg" style="width:75%" class="showcase" /></div><br />
	</div>
	
	<div class="side-left" style="width:30%; margin-left:3%; margin-top: 50px;">
	<ul>
		<li>Black lines are mandatory player actions in order to clear the game. Grey lines are optional interactions.</li>
		<li>The start of the game allows for exploration and most actions result in progression, but only one will lead to a series of linear events.</li>
		<li>Other optional actions are used to guide the player on the right path or give lore on the world and characters which can be useful later.</li>
		<li>Towards the middle of the game, the critical path splits in 3 that can be accomplished in any order.</li>
		<li>The ending wraps up all 3 paths into one ending, that differs depending on certain actions with the characters.</li>
		<li>The writer wrote the full dialogue in a separate document for each possibility using the coordinates from this chart. Those coordinates are also used in the game's code to make it easier to update.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<h2>The minigames</h2>
	<p>
	I was in charge of coming up with minigames to spice up the gameplay between dialogue sections. They had to fit the theme and not be too difficult since they are mandatory. I designed and coded 3 minigames:</p>
	
	<ul style="margin-left: 10%">
		<li>Tear apart a toaster/radio hybrid to get a specific piece.</li>
		<li>Pinball machine where the ball itself is the object you need to retreive, by using glitching the Demo mode and breaking the machine.</li>
		<li>Pipe machine where you have to purify a dirty liquid and then collect it.</li>
	</ul> <br/ >
