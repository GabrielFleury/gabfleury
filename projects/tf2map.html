	<h2>Team Fortress 2 map : cp_neighbor</h2>
	<p>This is a <i>Team Fortress 2</i> custom map I made using the Hammer editor. Team Fortress 2 is a 2007 team-based first person shooter by Valve.<br />
	In this game mode, BLU team has to capture point A and then B, while RED has to defend both under a time limit.<br />
	Downloads are available on <a href="https://tf2maps.net/downloads/cp_neighbor.5711/" target="_blank">TF2maps.net</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>About:</h3>
	<p>Most TF2 maps are set in rural landscapes and don't feature any streets or skyscrapers. My personal goal with this project was to create a map with an interesting layout despite being based on a rural neighborhood, which usually has plenty of empty straight lines. <br />
	To achieve this, most of the fights do not actually happen in the streets, and I am taking inspiration on cities built on mountains such as San Francisco and Montreal to justify streets having varying heights and odd turns. <br />
	The idea is that both teams spawn in apartment buildings on opposite sides and the fights happen in the buildings that got built between them.
	</p>
	
	<h3>My tasks:</h3>
	<p>Level design, level art (solo project)
	</p>

	<p style="text-align:center">Video following BLU team successfully attacking point A, then RED team defending point B.</p>
	
	<br /><br />
	<h2>Control point A</h2>
	
	<p>The first control point is meant to be easier for BLU to take. It is set between a shipping facility and an apartment building under construction. There are 3 different paths to reach it, making BLU ambushes possible from all directions. However, RED has multiple places for a viable sentry nest and can lock down some of those paths.</p>

	  </ul>  
	</div>
	
	
	<br /><br />
	<h2>Control point B</h2>
	
	<p>The second control point is set in the courtyard of a 1960s style hotel. It is much more cramped and is easier for RED to defend. It is closer to the RED spawn room, and BLU has no path dedicated to taking out the good sentry spots. BLU will need to focus their efforts on aggresive pushes rather than ambushing from all directions.

	<h2>Map layout sketch</h2>
	
	<p>My first version was much wider and had an extra path to the right of both points. After the first playtests in a full server, I've made the map more narrow, I altered the choke points to make them more viable to Red team, and some line of sights got shortened to make it harder for Snipers.<br />
	I keep my sketch updated to keep track of my changes and to plan how to fix what is unbalanced during playtests. I keep logs of what changed and why.<br />
	Here's how the map is currently layed out:
